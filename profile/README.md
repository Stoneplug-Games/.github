# Welcome to Stoneplug Games
If you stumbled by our humble abode, this organisation is just a group of friends making video-games together. 
You can hand around, but I'd expect the public page is barren. I wouldn't know, I'm the owner after all.

Contact [David, the owner](https://github.com/DavidVuescu) for any inquiries. 
Thank you for stopping by, have a lovely day.

> I have no idea what we're doing, but I already thought of a business plan ~ Andrei, co-owner
